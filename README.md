## Interactive Graphics  -  Final Project  -  2019

### Project requirements:

   > TODOS

   

2. **Can be done in groups of 1 to 4 persons;** 

   One person (just me).

   

3. **You can use «basic» WebGL or advanced libraries, such as [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/) or [Babylon](http://babylonjs.com/) or others (in this case they must be approved);** 

   The project is based on **ThreeJS** JavaScript 3D library (with a default WebGL renderer).

   The project also make use of additional JavaScript libraries, like:

   -   [Stats.JS](https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/)  -  Performance Monitor for JavaScript ;
   -   [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui)  -  Lightweight controller library for JavaScript (used for the application’s Control Panel Design);
   -   [Wavesurfer.JS](https://wavesurfer-js.org/)  -  a customizable audio waveform visualization, built on top of [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [HTML5 Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) (used for the HTML5 audio player core design and functionalities);
   -   [id3.js](https://github.com/43081j/id3)  -  Javascript ID3 tag parser for audio files (used by the HTML5 audio player);

   

4. **You can use models created with a modeler or found online. YOU CANNOT IMPORT ANIMATIONS;** 

   > TODOS

   

5. **The project MUST include:** 

   - **Hierarchical models:** 

     - At least one <u>and</u> more complex of the model used in *<u>homework2</u>*;

       > todos
       > 

   - **Lights and Textures:** 

     - At least one light, textures of different kinds (*color*, *normal*, *specular*, ... );

   - **User interaction:**  

     - Depends on your theme, as an example: *turn on/off lights*, *change viewpoint*, *configure colors*, *change difficulty*, ... ;

       > todos

       

   - **Animations:** 

     - Most objects should be animated, in particular the hierarchical models should perform animations that exploit their structure. ANIMATIONS CANNOT BE IMPORTED, should be implemented by you in javascript (WebGL, ThreeJS or other approved library)
